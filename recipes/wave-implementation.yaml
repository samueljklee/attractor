# =============================================================================
# Recipe 2: Wave Implementation
# =============================================================================
#
# Takes a wave of spec compliance gaps, implements fixes, tests, gets a
# multi-perspective review with automated convergence, and ships a PR.
#
# Staged recipe with 4 stages:
#   Stage 1 "implement-and-test"   - Validate specs, branch, extract spec text,
#                                    implement, test
#   Stage 2 "review-and-converge"  - Convergence loop: review -> fix -> re-review
#                                    (max 3 iterations, no approval)
#   Stage 3 "ship"                 - Commit, push, create PR via foundation:git-ops
#                                    (approval gate after stage completes)
#   Stage 4 "merge"               - Squash-merge after human approval
#
# The review-and-converge stage uses a while loop with while_steps to run
# up to 3 review iterations. Each iteration: correctness review (Sonnet) +
# simplification review (o3) -> synthesize -> apply must-fix items -> re-diff.
# Loop exits when synthesis verdict is APPROVE or max iterations reached.
#
# The implement-fixes step is the most expensive -- uses Opus 4 with a
# detailed instruction to read source, make changes, write tests, and run
# initial pytest.
#
# Typical runtime: 30-60 minutes (excluding approval wait)
# Required agents: foundation:explorer, foundation:modular-builder,
#                  foundation:zen-architect, foundation:git-ops
# Required tools:  git, gh (GitHub CLI), uv
#
# Usage:
#   amplifier tool invoke recipes operation=execute \
#     recipe_path=recipes/wave-implementation.yaml \
#     context='{"wave_name":"wave1-error-hierarchy","wave_items_description":"..."}'

# CHANGELOG
# =============================================================================
#
# v1.0.1 (2026-02-17):
#   - IMPROVEMENT: Added provider_preferences to apply-review-fixes
#     (anthropic/claude-opus-4 primary, openai/o3 fallback)
#   - IMPROVEMENT: create-branch uses git checkout -B to handle existing
#     branches instead of failing
#   - IMPROVEMENT: create-branch checks git status --porcelain for dirty
#     working directory before branching
#   - IMPROVEMENT: merge-pr has on_error: continue for graceful failure
#   - IMPROVEMENT: Added set -euo pipefail to run-mock-tests and
#     run-live-tests bash steps
#   - IMPROVEMENT: fix_results fed into review-correctness and
#     review-simplification prompts so reviewers see prior iteration fixes
#   - IMPROVEMENT: Added retry (max_attempts: 2, exponential backoff) to
#     all agent steps
#   - IMPROVEMENT: Added branch_prefix context variable (default "feat")
#   - IMPROVEMENT: Added test_command_mock and test_command_live context
#     variables to avoid repeating test commands across steps
#   - CLEANUP: Removed dead /tmp/wave-diff.patch file writes from
#     generate-diff and re-generate-diff steps (stdout capture is sufficient)
#   - CLEANUP: Removed unused output variables (validation_output,
#     branch_output)
#   - FIX: Added comment explaining why dummy echo exists in
#     review-converge-loop (while_condition requires a step body)
#   - FIX: Corrected stale changelog entries -- approval gates fire AFTER
#     a stage's steps complete, not before
#
# v1.2.0 (2026-02-16): [SUPERSEDED by v1.0.1 -- version scheme reset]
#   - Moved approval gate from stage "merge" to stage "ship"
#     NOTE: The v1.1.0 changelog incorrectly stated gates fire "before a
#     stage's steps run." Gates actually fire AFTER a stage completes.
#   - Added set -euo pipefail to generate-diff and re-generate-diff
#
# v1.1.0 (2026-02-16): [SUPERSEDED by v1.0.1 -- version scheme reset]
#   - Moved approval gate from stage "ship" to stage "merge"
#     NOTE: This changelog incorrectly stated "gates fire before a stage's
#     steps run." Gates actually fire AFTER a stage completes. The move
#     was therefore wrong and was corrected in v1.2.0.
#   - Changed commit-and-push and create-pr to foundation:git-ops agent steps
#   - Added provider fallback chains and retry to network operations
#   - Added spec file validation step
#
# v1.0.0 (2026-02-16): [SUPERSEDED by v1.0.1 -- version scheme reset]
#   - Initial recipe implementation

          WAVE ITEMS TO FIX:
          {{wave_items_description}}

          INSTRUCTIONS:
          1. Read the relevant source files to understand the current
             implementation. Start with the files mentioned in the spec
             requirements above.
          2. For EACH spec gap, implement the minimum change needed to comply
             with the verbatim spec text. Do not over-engineer.
          3. Write or update tests to verify each fix. Each spec requirement
             should have at least one test covering it.
          4. After implementing, run the mock test suite to verify:
               {{test_command_mock}}
          5. Fix any test failures before finishing.

          CONSTRAINTS:
          - Make targeted, minimal fixes -- do not refactor unrelated code
          - Keep changes focused on the spec requirements listed above
          - Preserve existing test coverage (do not delete passing tests)
          - Follow existing code style and patterns in the codebase

          When finished, provide a summary of:
          - Each fix made (file path, what changed, which spec requirement)
          - New or modified tests (file path, what they verify)

              3. Are there edge cases the spec mentions that aren't handled?
              4. Are the tests adequate to prove compliance?

              Report:
              - Per-item verdict: PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL
              - Must-fix issues (blocking -- things that are wrong or missing)

              3. After making changes, run the test suite:
                   {{test_command_mock}}
              4. Fix any test failures caused by your changes
              5. Do NOT introduce new features or refactor unrelated code

              Report what you changed and the test results.
